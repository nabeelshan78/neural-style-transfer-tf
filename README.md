# üñºÔ∏è Neural Style Transfer from Scratch (TensorFlow)

Transform your own images into mesmerizing works of art using **Neural Style Transfer**, implemented entirely **from scratch in TensorFlow**. This project combines deep learning and artistic expression by blending the **content** of one image with the **style** of another.

---

## Description

This repo showcases an end-to-end implementation of Neural Style Transfer (NST) based on the work by Gatys et al. It uses a pre-trained **VGG19** model to extract deep features and optimizes a new image to match the content of a content image and the style of a reference artwork.

## Features:
- Pure TensorFlow (no high-level APIs for training)
- Custom content/style loss functions
- Random noise + content image initialization
- Visualized training at multiple epochs
- Flexible configuration for images and layers

## Results

### Artistic Style Transfer Output Samples

| Content Image | Style Image | Stylized Output |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ![content](images/content/louvre.jpg) | ![style](images/style/monet.jpg) | ![output](images/output/louvre_monet_4000.jpg) |
| ![content](images/content/foot_ground.jpg) | ![style](images/style/drop-of-water.jpg) | ![output](images/output/football_water_drop_4000.jpg) |
| ![content](images/content/cat.jpg) | ![style](images/style/stone_style.jpg) | ![output](images/output/cat_stone_1250.jpg) |

### Side-by-Side Comparisons

These images show content, style, and output stitched together in one frame for better visual clarity.

## How It Works

1. **Preprocess Images** ‚Äì Resize and normalize input images.
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Use VGG19 to extract content & style features.
3. **Loss Calculation** ‚Äì Compute content and style losses from specific layers.
4. **Optimization** ‚Äì Train the generated image via backpropagation using `tf.GradientTape`.
5. **Visualize Results** ‚Äì Save intermediate outputs to see the style evolution.

## Key Customizations

**Style Layers** used:
  ```python
  STYLE_LAYERS = [
      ('block1_conv1', 0.2),
      ('block2_conv1', 0.2),
      ('block3_conv1', 0.2),
      ('block4_conv1', 0.2),
      ('block5_conv1', 0.2)
  ]

  Content Layer: block5_conv2

Loss Weights: alpha = 10, beta = 40 (customizable) 

```
